# Enhance Order Page - Development Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
Enhance the existing order management page with advanced order handling capabilities, bulk operations, and improved user experience.

## 📋 Current State Analysis
- Basic order viewing with DataGrid
- Account selection and status filtering
- Simple order list display
- No order editing or management capabilities

## 🚀 Enhancement Phases

### Phase 1: Order Detail Enhancement
**Objective**: Enable detailed order viewing and basic editing capabilities

**Tasks**:
1. Create OrderDetailModal component for viewing full order information
2. Add inline editing for order status with validation
3. Implement tracking number input and updates
4. Add order notes/comments system
5. Create order history/timeline component

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can view complete order details in modal
- Order status can be updated with proper validation
- Tracking numbers can be added and edited
- Order history is tracked and displayed
- Test coverage >= 90%

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for order editing workflow

### Phase 2: Bulk Operations
**Objective**: Enable efficient bulk management of multiple orders

**Tasks**:
1. Add multi-select functionality to order DataGrid
2. Create bulk status update component
3. Implement bulk tracking number upload via CSV
4. Add bulk export functionality (CSV/Excel)
5. Create bulk action confirmation dialogs

**Success Criteria**:
- Multiple orders can be selected and managed together
- Bulk status updates work reliably
- CSV tracking upload processes correctly
- Export includes all relevant order data
- Test coverage >= 90%

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for bulk operation components
- Integration tests for bulk API endpoints
- Performance tests for large datasets
- E2E tests for bulk workflows

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Objective**: Add intelligent automation and advanced search capabilities

**Tasks**:
1. Implement advanced search with multiple criteria
2. Add automated status transitions based on rules
3. Create order alert system for issues
4. Add customer communication integration
5. Implement order analytics dashboard

**Success Criteria**:
- Advanced search works with complex filters
- Automated rules trigger correctly
- Alerts notify of order issues
- Communication history is integrated
- Analytics provide actionable insights
- Test coverage >= 90%

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for search and automation logic
- Integration tests for rule engine
- E2E tests for complete workflows

## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing order data
- Ensure bulk operations can handle large datasets efficiently
- Implement proper loading states for all operations
- Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Follow existing UI/UX patterns from the application

### Performance Requirements
