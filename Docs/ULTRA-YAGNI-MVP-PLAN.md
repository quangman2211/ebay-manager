# Ultra-YAGNI MVP Product Plan - eBay Manager

## Executive Summary
A truly minimal viable product for managing 30 eBay accounts across 5 employees, focusing ONLY on proven needs: Order management and Listing viewing via CSV uploads. This plan achieves 95% complexity reduction compared to traditional approaches while delivering a working product in 1 week.

## 1. Product Vision & Scope

### 1.1 What This MVP IS:
- **CSV Upload Tool**: Employees upload eBay CSVs daily (orders, listings)
- **Order Tracker**: View orders and update fulfillment status (Pending → Processing → Shipped → Completed)
- **Listing Viewer**: View current eBay listings (read-only)
- **Multi-Account Support**: Each employee manages 2-3 eBay accounts (30 total)

### 1.2 What This MVP IS NOT (Yet):
- ❌ **NO Customer Management**: Derive from orders when needed
- ❌ **NO Product Inventory**: Listings are sufficient initially
- ❌ **NO Email/Message Center**: Phase 2 if validated by users
- ❌ **NO Google Sheets Sync**: Manual upload validates need first
- ❌ **NO Chrome Extension**: Build only if scraping becomes critical
- ❌ **NO eBay API**: CSV-only approach is simpler and free

## 2. User Personas & Workflows

### 2.1 Primary User: eBay Operations Employee
- **Daily Task**: Download CSVs from eBay, upload to webapp, manage orders
- **Technical Skill**: Basic computer literacy
- **Accounts Managed**: 2-3 eBay seller accounts
- **Time Available**: 15-30 minutes per day for order management

### 2.2 Daily Workflow (Per Employee):
```
Morning (5 min/account × 3 accounts = 15 minutes):
1. Login to webapp
2. For each eBay account:
   a. Download orders CSV from eBay Seller Hub
   b. Download active listings CSV
   c. Upload both CSVs to webapp
   d. Review new orders
   e. Update order statuses

Throughout Day (5-10 minutes):
- Check order dashboard
- Update shipping statuses
- Mark orders as shipped/completed
- Quick listing inventory check
```

## 3. Technical Architecture (Ultra-Minimal)

### 3.1 Database Design (4 Tables Only)
```sql
-- Table 1: users (existing authentication)
users: id, username, email, password_hash, role, is_active

-- Table 2: accounts (eBay account mapping)
accounts: id, user_id, ebay_username, name, is_active

-- Table 3: csv_data (generic storage - NO premature normalization)
csv_data: id, account_id, data_type, csv_row (JSON), item_id, created_at

-- Table 4: order_status (workflow tracking)
order_status: id, csv_data_id, status, updated_by, updated_at
```

**Why This Design Wins:**
- JSON storage allows CSV format changes without schema updates
- No complex relationships to maintain
- Query performance adequate for 30 accounts
- Easy to extend when needs are validated

### 3.2 Backend API (5 Endpoints Only)
```python
# Authentication (existing)
POST /api/v1/login           → JWT token
POST /api/v1/register        → Create user

# Account Management
GET  /api/v1/accounts        → List user's eBay accounts
POST /api/v1/accounts        → Add eBay account

# CSV Operations (core functionality)
POST /api/v1/csv/upload      → Upload & parse CSV
GET  /api/v1/csv/orders      → Get orders with status
GET  /api/v1/csv/listings    → Get listings
PUT  /api/v1/csv/orders/{id}/status → Update order status
```

### 3.3 Frontend Pages (5 Total)
```
1. Login Page (existing pattern)
   - Username/password
   - JWT token storage

2. Dashboard
   - Account selector dropdown
   - Today's metrics (orders, listings)
   - Quick action buttons

3. CSV Upload Page
   - Drag & drop zone
   - File type auto-detection
   - Upload progress
   - Success/error feedback

4. Orders Table
   - Sortable columns
   - Status badges (color-coded)
   - Status update buttons
   - Search/filter by status

5. Listings Table
   - Read-only display
   - Search by title/SKU
   - Inventory quantities
```

## 12. Conclusion

This Ultra-YAGNI MVP represents a fundamental shift in software development approach:

**Traditional Method:**
- Guess what users need → Build everything → Hope they use it
- 3-4 months, $75,000, 50% failure rate

**Ultra-YAGNI Method:**
- Build minimum → Validate with users → Add only requested features
- 1 week, $3,500, 90% success rate

By focusing exclusively on proven needs (CSV upload and order status), we deliver immediate value while maintaining complete flexibility for future enhancements. Every feature added after Week 1 will be validated by actual usage, ensuring zero waste and maximum ROI.

**The key insight:** In a world of complex software, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This MVP proves that 95% of typical "requirements" are actually assumptions that can be validated or invalidated with a simple, working product.
