I want to develop two features in parallel for my EBAY MANAGER APP using Git worktrees:

1. Data export system (CSV, PDF, JSON exports)
2. Analytics dashboard (charts, insights, trends)

Please help me set up the worktree environment:
1. Create a worktree for the export feature at ../expense-tracker-export with branch 
feature/data-export
2. Create a worktree for the analytics feature at ../expense-tracker-analytics with branch 
feature/analytics-dashboard
3. List all worktrees to confirm they were created
4. Explain what each worktree will contain and how they're isolated

I want to be able to work on both features simultaneously without conflicts.
