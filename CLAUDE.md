# eBay Management System

## Project Overview
Multi-account eBay management system without API usage, syncing data via CSV files from eBay.

## Architecture Principles (MANDATORY)
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: All code MUST follow SOLID & YAGNI. Violating code will be rejected immediately.

### SOLID Principles (REQUIRED)
- **S - Single Responsibility**: Each class/function has only 1 reason to change
- **O - Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification  
- **L - Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **I - Interface Segregation**: No dependency on unused interfaces
- **D - Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### YAGNI Principle (REQUIRED)  
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It**: Only implement features when actually needed
- No "just in case" or "might be useful later" code
- Refactor when needed, don't over-engineer upfront

## Core Features

### 1. Order Management
- Import/update orders from eBay CSV files
- Manage order status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Update tracking numbers and shipping status
- Track order fulfillment timeline

### 2. Listing Management  
- Import/update listings from eBay CSV files
- Manage listing status (active, inactive, out of stock, ended)
- Track listing performance metrics
- Bulk update listing status

### 3. Product Management
- Manage products by suppliers
- Import/update product data from CSV files
- Track inventory levels and pricing
- Product categorization and tagging

### 4. Customer Management
- Manage customers based on order history  
- Classify: new, returning, VIP, problematic customers
- Customer lifetime value tracking
- Purchase pattern analysis

### 5. Communication Management
- Import emails from Gmail API
- Import messages from eBay CSV exports
- Unified inbox for customer communications
- Response templates and automation

## Multi-Account Structure
- Each eBay account runs on separate browser profile
- Each user manages max 2-3 eBay accounts
- Account-level data isolation
- Cross-account reporting and analytics

## Technical Stack Recommendations
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- **File Processing**: Pandas (Python) or csv-parser (Node.js)
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with responsive design
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access

## Development Guidelines (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)

### Code Quality Requirements
üö® **ZERO TOLERANCE**: SOLID/YAGNI violating code will be rejected immediately

### Mandatory Patterns
- **Repository pattern** for data access (Single Responsibility)
- **Service layer** for business logic (Separation of Concerns)
- **Dependency Injection** for loose coupling (Dependency Inversion)
- **Interface-based design** (Interface Segregation)
- **Clear separation of concerns** - no mixing business logic with data access

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Does each class have exactly 1 responsibility?
- [ ] Does function have too many parameters? (Interface Segregation)
- [ ] Any hard-coded dependencies? (Dependency Inversion)
- [ ] Any "just in case" features implemented? (YAGNI violation)
- [ ] Can code be extended without modification? (Open/Closed)

### Enforcement Rules
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper exception hierarchy
- **Logging and monitoring** with structured logging
- **Unit tests** for all business logic (Test-Driven Development)
- **No premature optimization** - measure first, then optimize

## Data Models (Core Entities)
- Account (eBay accounts)
- User (system users)  
- Order
- Listing
- Product
- Customer
- Supplier
- Communication (emails/messages)

## CSV Import Strategy
- Scheduled imports or manual trigger
- Data validation and error handling
- Incremental updates with conflict resolution
- Import history and rollback capability

## Planning Guidelines
- When user requests planning, create separate file with format: `[plan-name]-plan.md`
- Plan files stored in project root directory
- Each plan file should include:
  - Overview of task/feature
  - Technical approach and architecture decisions
  - Step-by-step implementation phases
  - Dependencies and prerequisites
  - Success criteria and testing strategy
- Plan files help document decision-making process for future reference
- Use naming convention: `tech-stack-plan.md`, `order-management-plan.md`, etc.

## Commands to remember
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production  
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Code linting
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking
