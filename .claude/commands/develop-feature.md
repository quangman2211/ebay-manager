I need to develop a feature using TDD approach. The feature name will be provided as an argument.

Please help me:

1. **Understand the Feature**: Read current-sprint.md to get the user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks
2. **Plan Implementation**: Break down the feature into specific development steps following SOLID principles
3. **Write Tests First**: Create failing tests for the feature (TDD approach)
4. **Implement Code**: Build the minimum code to make tests pass
5. **Ensure Quality**: Verify 90% test coverage and SOLID compliance

The feature should be implemented following our conventions.md guidelines:
- SOLID principles (mandatory)
- YAGNI approach (no over-engineering)
- 90% minimum test coverage
- Proper error handling
- No console.log statements

Please start with the specified feature and guide me through the TDD implementation process.
